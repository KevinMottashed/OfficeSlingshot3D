CHAI 3D is an open source set of C++ libraries for computer haptics, 
visualization  and interactive real-time simulation. CHAI 3D supports 
several commercially-available three-, six- and seven-degree-of-freedom 
haptic devices, and makes it simple to support new custom force feedback 
devices. \n

For a general introduction to the CHAI 3D libraries, we highly recommend to 
review in numerical order the well documented examples provided with the 
framework. \n

For overviews of various selected features or general organization of 
CHAI 3D, see the above \b "Modules" and \b "Files" links. \n

Some functionalities or support for certain haptic devices may vary 
depending of the operating system you are using. CHAI 3D is 
currently supported on the following platforms: \n\n

<b> Windows [32-bit] </b>\n
[delta.x, omega.x, falcon, phantom, freedom6] \n \n
<b> Windows [64-bit] </b>\n 	
[delta.x, omega.x, phantom] \n \n
<b> Mac OS-X  [universal] </b>\n 
[delta.x, omega.x] \n \n
<b> Linux [32-bit] </b>\n
[delta.x, omega.x] \n \n
<b> Linux [64-bit] </b>\n
[delta.x, omega.x] \n \n \n

See <http://www.chai3d.org/> for more information about CHAI 3D.

<b> IMPORTANT NOTE: the online documentation for the CHAI 3D libraries is 
a continuous work-in-progress. </b> \n
Although the large majority of classes have been documented properly, there 
might still be some poorly documented items. If you happen upon an 
undocumented or poorly documented class and / or class method which you 
find hard to understand, please give us a notice so we can rectify the 
situation.
